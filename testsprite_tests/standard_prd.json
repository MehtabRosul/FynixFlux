  "product_overview": "Fynix Flux ML is a comprehensive machine learning operations platform integrating an interactive Insight Hub and robust Dashboard. It enables users to upload datasets, train and monitor ML models in real-time, perform AI-driven workflow automation, and export model artifacts with secure, audit-compliant processes.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Provide an intuitive, end-to-end ML workflow from data upload through model training to artifact export.",
    "Enable live monitoring and detailed insights into training progress and metrics via an interactive dashboard.",
    "Integrate AI-powered workflows for model explanation and automation within the system's Insight Hub.",
    "Ensure secure handling of data and models with audit logging, PII detection, and consent mechanisms.",
    "Support multiple dataset formats and seamless model artifact management with export/payment gating.",
    "Deliver a highly responsive UI with modern frontend technologies and interactive visualizations."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Landing page with engaging parallax effects and animated components to introduce the product.",
    "Comprehensive Dashboard for model training, testing, monitoring, and management with live metrics charts and control panels.",
    "Data upload system supporting diverse file formats including CSV, Excel, Parquet, Avro, XML, and YAML with dataset preview and type inference.",
    "Model management for training initiation, model testing, artifact tracking, and export functionalities.",
    "Insight Hub leveraging Genkit AI and Google AI for prompt-driven workflow automation, model testing, and explanation.",
    "Real-time WebSocket streaming of training metrics, logs, checkpoints, and completion events enabling dynamic UI updates.",
    "Secure export process including payment gating, checksum verification, and artifact downloads.",
    "Extensive UI component library built with shadcn/ui and Radix UI for consistent styling and usability.",
    "Layout components for flexible page structures including dashboard and documentation views.",
    "Comprehensive documentation, legal, and contact pages ensuring transparency and user assistance.",
    "Custom hooks and utility functions for optimized frontend behavior and theming."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User visits the landing page and explores features with smooth parallax scrolling effects.",
    "User logs into the dashboard area to manage ML projects and access the Insight Hub without page navigation.",
    "User uploads datasets in supported formats, previews data, and triggers prompt-driven model training via the Insight Hub.",
    "System submits the training job, returning a task ID and establishing a WebSocket connection for live metric streaming.",
    "User monitors live training metrics and logs updating in real time on the dashboard charts and feeds.",
    "Upon training completion, user accesses artifact metadata, completes payment for export, and downloads the model with SHA256 checksum verification.",
    "User may trigger automated QA testing for robustness, calibration, and fairness reports on the trained model.",
    "System ensures audit logs are maintained for all state changes and enforces PII detection with consent before external exports.",
    "State recovery is supported via event replay API after reloads or worker failures ensuring resilient user experience."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Health endpoint returns status 200 with correct payload, and user is able to log in successfully.",
    "Insight Hub opens in-place without navigation; prompt bar auto-focuses; top controls hide with smooth animation.",
    "Dataset uploads correctly and previews with accurate type inference; PII detection warnings trigger if applicable.",
    "Prompt validation enforces minimum length and filters forbidden patterns before submission.",
    "Training job submissions return valid task IDs; WebSocket streams metrics, logs, checkpoints, and completion messages continuously.",
    "Live dashboard charts and feeds update in real time with training progress and metrics.",
    "Completed artifacts are listed with correct metadata; export is gated by payment confirmation and checksum verified on download.",
    "Automated QA reports are generated correctly when testing is requested.",
    "Audit logs comprehensively capture all state mutations with user and timestamp information.",
    "State recovery via replay API restores UI and data after reloads or interruptions flawlessly.",
    "Security compliance checks confirm no raw prompt storage, encrypted audit logs, and consent enforcement on PII exports."
